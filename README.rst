PyDy_, short for Python Dynamics, is a tool kit written in the Python
programming language that utilizes an array of scientific programs to enable
the study of multibody dynamics. The goal is to have a modular framework and
eventually a physics abstraction layer which utilizes a variety of backends
that can provide the user with their desired workflow, including:

.. _PyDy: http://pydy.org

- Model specification
- Equation of motion generation
- Simulation
- Visualization
- Publication

We started by building the SymPy_ `mechanics package`_ which provides an API
for building models and generating the symbolic equations of motion for complex
multibody systems. More recently we developed two packages, `pydy.codegen`
and `pydy.viz`, for simulation and visualization of the models, respectively.
This Python package contains these two packages and other tools for working
with SymPy mechanics. The remaining tools currently used in the PyDy workflow
are popular scientific Python packages such as NumPy_, SciPy_, IPython_, and
matplotlib_ (i.e. the SciPy stack) which provide additional code for numerical
analyses, simulation, and visualization.

.. _SymPy: http://sympy.org
.. _mechanics package: http://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/physics/mechanics/index.html
.. _NumPy: http://numpy.scipy.org
.. _SciPy: http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html
.. _IPython: http://ipython.org
.. _matplotlib: http://matplotlib.org

Installation
============

PyDy has hard dependencies on the following software:

- Python >= 2.7, < 3
- setuptools\ [#]_
- SymPy_ >= 0.7.4.1
- NumPy_ >= 1.6.1
- SciPy_ >= 0.9.0

.. [#] setuptools >= 8.0 is required if development versions of SymPy are used.

PyDy has optional dependencies on these packages:

- IPython_ >= 0.2.0
- Cython_ >= 0.15.1
- Theano_ >= 0.6.0

.. _Theano: http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/
.. _Cython: http://cython.org/

The examples may require these dependencies:

- matplotlib_

It's best to install the SciPy Stack dependencies using the instructions_
provided on the SciPy website. We recommend the conda_ package manager and the
Anaconda_ distribution for easy cross platform installation.

.. _instructions: http://www.scipy.org/install.html
.. _conda: http://conda.pydata.org/
.. _Anaconda: http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/

Once the dependencies are installed, the latest stable version of the package
can be downloaded from PyPi::

   $ wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pydy/pydy-0.2.1.tar.gz

and extracted and installed\ [#]_::

   $ tar -zxvf pydy-0.2.1.tar.gz
   $ cd pydy-0.2.1
   $ python setup.py install

Or if you have the pip package manager installed you can simply type::

   $ pip install pydy

.. [#] For system wide installs you may need root permissions (perhaps prepend
   commands with ``sudo``).

Usage
=====

This is an example of a simple one degree of freedom system: a mass under the
influence of a spring, damper, gravity and an external force::


   / / / / / / / / /
   -----------------
     |    |     |   | g
     \   | |    |   V
   k /   --- c  |
     |    |     | x, v
    --------    V
    |  m   | -----
    --------
       | F
       V

Derive the system::

   from sympy import symbols
   import sympy.physics.mechanics as me

   mass, stiffness, damping, gravity = symbols('m, k, c, g')

   position, speed = me.dynamicsymbols('x v')
   positiond = me.dynamicsymbols('x', 1)
   force = me.dynamicsymbols('F')

   ceiling = me.ReferenceFrame('N')

   origin = me.Point('origin')
   origin.set_vel(ceiling, 0)

   center = origin.locatenew('center', position * ceiling.x)
   center.set_vel(ceiling, speed * ceiling.x)

   block = me.Particle('block', center, mass)

   kinematic_equations = [speed - positiond]

   force_magnitude = mass * gravity - stiffness * position - damping * speed + force
   forces = [(center, force_magnitude * ceiling.x)]

   particles = [block]

   kane = me.KanesMethod(ceiling, q_ind=[position], u_ind=[speed],
                         kd_eqs=kinematic_equations)
   kane.kanes_equations(forces, particles)

Create a system to manage integration and specify numerical values for the
constants and specified quantities. Here, we specify sinusoidal forcing::

   from numpy import array, linspace, sin
   from pydy.system import System

   sys = System(kane,
                constants={mass: 1.0, stiffness: 1.0,
                           damping: 0.2, gravity: 9.8},
                specifieds={force: lambda x, t: sin(t)},
                initial_conditions={position: 0.1, speed: -1.0},
                times=linspace(0.0, 10.0, 1000))

Integrate the equations of motion to get the state trajectories::

   y = sys.integrate()

Plot the results::

   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   plt.plot(sys.times, y)
   plt.legend((str(position), str(speed)))
   plt.show()

Documentation
=============

The documentation is hosted at http://pydy.readthedocs.org but you can also
build them from source using the following instructions.

To build the documentation you must install the dependencies:

- Sphinx_
- numpydoc_

.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx-doc.org/
.. _numpydoc: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpydoc

To build the HTML docs, run Make from within the ``docs`` directory::

   $ cd docs
   $ make html

You can then view the documentation from your preferred web browser, for
example::

   $ firefox _build/html/index.html

Modules and Packages
====================

Code Generation (codegen)
-------------------------

This package provides code generation facilities. It generates functions that
can numerically evaluate the right hand side of the ordinary differential
equations generated with sympy.physics.mechanics_ with three different
backends: SymPy's lambdify_, Theano, and Cython.

.. _sympy.physics.mechanics: http://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/physics/mechanics
.. _lambdify: http://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/utilities/lambdify.html#sympy.utilities.lambdify.lambdify

Models (models.py)
------------------

The models module provides some canned models of classic systems.

Systems (system.py)
-------------------

The System module provides a ``System`` class to manage simulation of a single
system.

Visualization (viz)
-------------------

This package provides tools to create 3D animated visualizations of the
systems. The visualizations utilize WebGL and run in a web browser. They can
also be embedded into an IPython notebook for added interactivity.

Development Environment
=======================

The source code is managed with the Git version control system. To get the
latest development version and access to the full repository, clone the
repository from Github with::

   $ git clone https://github.com/pydy/pydy.git

You should then install the dependencies for running the tests:

- nose_: 1.3.0
- phantomjs_: 1.9.0

.. _nose: https://nose.readthedocs.org
.. _phantomjs: http://phantomjs.org

Isolated Environments
---------------------

It is typically advantageous to setup a virtual environment to isolate the
development code from other versions on your system. There are two popular
environment managers that work well with Python packages: virtualenv and
conda_.

The following installation assumes you have virtualenvwrapper_ in addition to
virtualenv and all the dependencies needed to build the various packages::

   $ mkvirtualenv pydy-dev
   (pydy-dev)$ pip install numpy scipy cython nose theano sympy ipython[all]
   (pydy-dev)$ pip install matplotlib # make sure to do this after numpy
   (pydy-dev)$ git clone git@github.com:pydy/pydy.git
   (pydy-dev)$ cd pydy
   (pydy-dev)$ python setup.py develop

.. _virtualenvwrapper: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenvwrappe://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenvwrapper

Or with conda_::

   $ conda create -n pydy-dev setuptools numpy scipy ipython ipython-notebook cython nose theano sympy matplotlib
   $ source activate pydy-dev
   (pydy-dev)$ git clone git@github.com:pydy/pydy.git
   (pydy-dev)$ cd pydy
   (pydy-dev)$ python setup.py develop

The full Python test suite can be run with::

   (pydy-dev)$ nosetests

For the JavaScript tests the Jasmine and blanket.js libraries are used. Both
of these libraries are included in pydy.viz with the source. To run the
JavaScript tests::

   cd pydy/viz/static/js/tests && phantomjs run-jasmine.js SpecRunner.html && cd ../../../../../

Benchmark
=========

Run the benchmark to test the n-link pendulum problem with the various backends::

   $ python bin/benchmark_pydy_code_gen.py <max # of links> <# of time steps>
