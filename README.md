These are examples of using the various tools in PyDy to simulate and study the
motion of classical dynamic systems. The equations of motion for the systems
are typically derived with SymPy Mechanics and the numerical work done with a
variety of other packages, such as:

- NumPy/SciPy
- python-control
- Matlab
- GSL
- IPython

Each folder contains the files for one example. To contribute, make a pull
request. The new folder should include a readme explaining the problem, a
figure, and the source code for the example. Code written in python should
roughly adhere to PEP8: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/. There are
some exceptions, such as naming of variables. Use your best judgment.
